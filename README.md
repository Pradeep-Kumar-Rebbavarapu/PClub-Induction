# Starting The Backend Server
```bash
# Starting The Backend Server
# Make Sure All Terminal Commands Are Done In Command Prompt Inside VS CODE
# After Cloning The Git Repo Make Sure You Are Inside Your PClub-induction Directory
# STEP 1
python -m venv venv
# STEP 2
venv\Scripts\activate
# STEP 3
cd backend
# STEP 5
pip install -r requirements.txt
# STEP 6
python manage.py runserver
```
Well We Must Understand That Since Backend Is Now Deployed So Any Changes In The Backend Does Not Reflect In The Frontend As Its Not a Local Server So Basicly Running 
THe Backend Server Is Not Mandatory.
